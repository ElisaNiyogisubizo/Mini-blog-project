# Mini Blog - Dev Insights

Welcome to the **Mini Blog** project! This platform is designed for employees at "Dev Insights" to share quick tips, insights, and updates related to web development. The project is built with **React** and **TypeScript** and showcases key concepts such as components, optimization, styling, and more.

## Project Setup

This project was built using **Vite** for fast bundling and **TypeScript** for static typing. To get started with the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd mini-blog
npm install
```

### 3. Run the Application

To start the development server and run the application:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will open the application in your browser, typically at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- **Header Component**: Displays the logo and a link to the "New Post" page.
- **PostList Component**: Lists blog posts with a title, author, content preview, and publication date.
- **Post Component**: Displays detailed information about a single blog post.
- **New Post Badge**: Highlights posts published within the last 24 hours with a "New!" badge.
- **Component Optimization**: Utilizes `React.memo` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- **Higher-Order Component (HOC)**: Logs messages when a component is mounted and unmounted, using the `withLogger` HOC.

---

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript**: Superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **Vite**: Next-generation front-end build tool that is fast and optimized for modern web development.
- **CSS**: Used for styling components.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Install dependencies** using `npm install`.
3. **Start the development server** with `npm run dev`.

The app will be live at `http://localhost:3000` and will automatically reload when you make changes.

## Component Structure

### 1. **Header Component**

The `Header` component displays the "Dev Insights" logo and a link to "New Post." It serves as the navigation bar for the platform.

### 2. **PostList Component**

The `PostList` component is responsible for rendering a list of blog posts. For now, the posts are hardcoded within the component.

### 3. **Post Component**

The `Post` component renders the details of a single blog post, including the title, author, content preview, and publication date. It accepts props with the blog post data.

### 4. **App Component**

The `App` component is the root component, responsible for rendering the `Header` and `PostList` components.

---

## Optimization Strategies

### React.memo

To prevent unnecessary re-renders of the `Post` component, we have used `React.memo`. This helps optimize the appâ€™s performance by ensuring that a component only re-renders when its props change.

```tsx
const Post: React.FC<PostProps> = React.memo(
  ({ title, author, content, date }) => {
    return (
      <div className="post">
        <h2>{title}</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>{author}</strong> | {date}
        </p>
        <p>{content.substring(0, 100)}...</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
);
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. **Learning TypeScript with React**

One of the challenges was getting comfortable with TypeScript in a React environment. Initially, I found it a bit tricky to define types for props and components, but using **TypeScript interfaces** to define component props made it much easier to manage types and catch potential errors early.

### 2. **Component Re-renders**

Another challenge was preventing unnecessary re-renders in the `Post` component when the list of posts grew. I resolved this by using **`React.memo`** to ensure the `Post` component only re-renders when the props actually change.

### 3. **Conditional Styling**

Adding the "New!" badge for posts published within the last 24 hours was a fun challenge, as it required me to manipulate the date and apply conditional CSS styling. This was resolved using simple JavaScript logic within the component and applying dynamic class names based on the condition.

## External Libraries

- **Vite**: A fast build tool that improves the development experience.
- **React**: The JavaScript library used for building the user interface.
- **TypeScript**: Provides static typing for better maintainability and developer experience.
- **CSS**: Used for styling components (could be replaced with styled-components for more scalability).

## Conclusion

This **Mini Blog** project demonstrates the key concepts of **React** and **TypeScript**, including component creation, prop typing, optimization with `React.memo`, and the use of Higher-Order Components (HOCs). It also showcases how to work with conditional styling and basic CSS for a clean and responsive design.

Feel free to explore the code, and I encourage you to extend it further with additional features like creating new posts, saving posts to a backend, or implementing authentication.
